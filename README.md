Hi, I’m Amy. I'm a <a href="https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/see/staff/10009/dr-amy-mcguire">Research Fellow in Quaternary Palynology</a> in the School of Earth and Environment at the University of Leeds. 
My interests lie, primarily, in the reconstruction of past environmental change, particularly in how vegetation responds to changes in climate on a range of timescales.
I'm here to learn - I'm hoping to improve my Python skills, and also to get better at making all my code readable! Mostly, I'd like to to make the palaeoenvironmental data I produce accessible and easy to work with.
I can be contacted by email at a.mcguire@leeds.ac.uk, or alternatively find me on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/amymcg">@amymcg</a>.
